# Financial-RAG-Chatbot
Hi ,I have created this chatbot by implementing RAG on a data extracted from screener.in Please enjoy the ride through this chatbot 

#WEEK1
-So this is the first station week1... welcome guys..
here I had learnt about various ways of how can your AI bot understand "text" data whether you are talking about how "cool" you are or just yapping like "you" usually do!!
so there are many methods that you can do ...

#WEEK2
-So this is when I start getting my hands messy with RAG. Now RAG is not just any random 3 letter word but something very crazy that can help you achieve your dream of making a chatbot .
Ever imagined this chat gpt that u use everyday that can answer all the range of questions from "how cool you are?" to "what is the answer for this exam question?" how could some bunch of random guys code it all up
well, RAG is not exactly what chat gpt does but you can use chat gpt to help u answer questions about data that chat gpt hasnt been trained on. It can be anything from your emails to your college profs boring lecture notes.

Here is a google colab link on trying to implement RAG on code - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HTPq8iUzDUpg-jzoBB8_tCw_tpH77gMm?usp=sharing 

all the resources used to learn the theory part i shall add in the resources folder.
